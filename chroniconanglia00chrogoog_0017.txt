Among the manuscripts forming the Cotton
collection in the British Museum is a book
written on vellum of a size between 8vo. and
lto. [Claud A.V.] containing about two hun-
dred leaves, os which the first part, containing
about forty leaves, was not written before the
year 1368: for it contains a work entitled
Chronicon Angliae, which beginning with the
year os our Lord 654, records events that hap-
pened so late as the year above mentioned.
The rest of the manuscript is of the early part
of the thirteenth century. The contento of
the whole volume are as follows:

1. Chronicon Petroburgense a fundatione ejusdem
monasterii ab anno Christi 604 ad annum 1368.
Continet seriem Abbatum monasterii ejusdem et
Priorum Spaldingensis ecclesiae in comitatu Lin-

colniensi per Johannem Abbatem Burgi Sancti
Petri.
