sarraca. xiii

script furnished to the editor by John Bridges,
and does not seem to have been afterwards
collated with the Cotton original. This cir-
cumstance will account for the existence of
several errore, such as Londoniorn for Romam,
fillis for fratribus, and many others, which
have all now been carefully corrected.

In the orthography of proper names os per-
sons and places the Chronicle is singularly in-
consistent, and though I have reduced alarge
number of them to some degree ol uniformityâ€š
particularly in the case of the most familiar,
yet it has been found difficult to accomplish it
altogether, and 1 have been at fault in so many
instances to determine what person or place
the author alluded to, that it became necessary
to retain the orthography of the manuscript

for fear os worse consequences.
